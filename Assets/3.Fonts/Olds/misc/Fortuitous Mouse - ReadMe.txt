FORTUITOUS MOUSE
A Font by S. John Ross

One of my favorite genres of type design, if we even dare call it that, is this one, the hand-drawn Roman, which makes no attempt to look like individual handwriting, but rather the kind of warm, flawed, festive writing that someone might marker onto a jar of homemade preserves or a Christmas box of cookies. I've done a few of these by now (Kentucky Fireplace and Apple Butter are probably my favorites, to be joined, I hope, by this one and more to follow). FORTUITOUS MOUSE is fairly well-stocked with characters for use both here in Colorado, where it was drawn, and around the world wherever the Roman alphabet or something like it finds a place. Here's hoping you use it for something comforting.
